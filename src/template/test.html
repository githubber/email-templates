Since TCamp is an “unconference” (a discussion-based conference where the participants set the agenda), its success relies on the participation of attendees to create an engaging environment. That means we need your help! Register for TCamp14 and you can help us make this our best TCamp yet. <a href="#">Share the link</a> and your ideas to help shape the conversation around TCamp14. You can even sign up to be a TransparencyCamp Ambassador and help grow the opengov community. We’ve sold out of tickets the last two years, so <a href="#">register for TCamp14 today</a> – before it’s too late. We can’t wait to see what you will bring to this year’s TCamp!</p>

We’ve compiled the paths of <a href="#">60,000 bills</a> introduced in the last five Congresses into one graph – and it’s not a pretty picture. Many bills bounce back and forth between the chambers and few take the familiar path through the House and Senate that we learned in civics class. This graph (and the subsequent graphs for each individual Congress) provides insight into the winding and complicated path – full of stops and starts – that most bills go through. But don’t just study this graph, <a href="#">start tracking bills you care about with OpenCongress</a> and follow the complicated path a bill takes yourself!</p>

The <a href="#">/unitedstates project</a> is a collaboration between open government and open source technologists to make government accountability tools more accessible to developers. So, we want feedback from you on how to make the tool as useful as possible for your project. Check out <a href="#">how to run the parser</a> and then tell us how we can make the tool better for your use. You can also <a href="#">contribute to the Congressional-Record parser</a> or other parts of the <a href="#">/unitedstates project</a> and help us make these tools as accessible as possible for the open government community!</p>
